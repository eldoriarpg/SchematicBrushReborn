# Schematic Brush Reborn
![## Description](http://chojo.u.catgirlsare.sexy/wHmbIpte.png)  

Schematic Brush Reborn is a complete new rewrite of the old [Schematic Brush](https://github.com/mikeprimm/SchematicBrush)
which doesn't received any updates for version 1.13+.

So we decided to write it new from scratch and make it even better than before. We added several new functionalities,
which should make using schematic brushes easier.

We added tab complete for nearly everything. You can start directly and learn from the plugin on the fly how to use it.
We load schematics from our own schematic folder, of FAWE and World Edit. So we don't care, where you store your schematics.
We support every schematic format which World Edit supports.

We allow you to save your favorite schematic sets as a preset.
You can use them every time and even combine them with other presets.

![## Features](http://chojo.u.catgirlsare.sexy/64F0fGlX.png)  

+ Use schematics from your server as a world edit brush.
+ Modify your current brush every time without creating a new one.
+ Customize your brush with different flags
+ Use weighted schematic sets to keep control of your schematics.
+ Use random schematic sets to get more diversity.
+ Save your favorite schematics sets as a set to use them everytime.

![## Requirements](http://chojo.u.catgirlsare.sexy/jtvCkmgC.png)  

Spigot or Paper 1.13 and above.  
Java 11 and above.  
WorldEdit 7.1 and above.  
FAWE is also supported, but on the current state pretty unstable.  

![## How does it work?](http://chojo.u.catgirlsare.sexy/V05UGdwq.png)  

A schematic brush can contain one or more schematic sets. So a brush is a collection of one or more schematic sets.

A schematic set is defined by a selector and several modifications of the schematic. The general syntax is:

`<selector>@rotation!flip:weight`

The modifiers are optional, and the order doesn't matter.

The brush itself has some flags, which allows to set a place method, offset and replacement rules.

`/sbr <schematic sets...> <flags...>`

You don't have to remember any of this. The plugin features a rich tabcomplete, which supports you all the time.

![autocomplete image](http://chojo.u.catgirlsare.sexy/WJ3Eh7N2.png)  

We also track your schematic, preset and directory names. We can complete everything for you.

### Schematic Set
A schematic set consists of a selector and optional modifiers.

#### Selector
A selector can be several things.

##### Name
A name. This will use every schematic which exactly matches this name.
If you want a broader search you can add a * at the end. This will use every schematic which starts with the name.

`<name>@rotation!flip:weight`
+ `tree_*` - this will match all schematics which start with tree_ 
+ `tree_acacia_01` - This will match the schematic with the name 'tree_acacia_01'

##### Regex
 If you want it more specific you can use a regex too. A regex has to start with a `^`.

`^<regex>@rotation!flip:weight`
+ `^tree_.+?` - This will match all schematics that start with tree
+ `^tree_acacia_[0-9]{1,3}` - This will match all schematics that start with tree_acacia_ and have the number 1-999 at the end.
+ For further information I recommend this [site](https://www.regextester.com/)

##### Directory
If you are an organized human, you have all your schematics properly sorted in folders.
You can select all schematics inside a folder with:

`$<directory>@rotation!flip:weight`
+ `$tree` - Uses all schematics inside the folder trees

##### Preset
A saved preset can be loaded with:
`&<preset>@rotation!flip:weight`

#### Modifier
Modifiers are optional. The order doesn't matter.

The entered values will be applied before pasting the schematic.

Every modifier has some explicit values.
For flip and rotation you can use a `*` for a random value.
These will change everytime the brush pastes a schematic.

##### Flip
You can flip a schematic on the North South Axis (N) or on the East West Axis (E).
Probably all values are valid, but they do all the same. So N is equals to S and NS and SN.
If the `*` is used the rotation will be None, N and E.

`!flip`

##### Rotation
The rotation can be 0 which is default, 90, 180 or 270.
If the `*` is used the rotation will be 0, 90, 180 or 270.

`@rotation`

##### Weight
The weight defines the chance the brush is used, if a schematic brush contains more than one brush.
If a brush doesn't have a weight the average of all weighted brushes will be used.

`:weight`

### Brush Flags
A brush can have several flags which change the behaviour of the brush and the placement of the schematics.
All flags have a short form.

#### Placement
A schematic can be placed in several ways.
Before a schematic is placed, we modify the origin of the schematic.
The origin position is equal to the block you pointed at with the block.
The origin is always at the x and z center of your schematic, but we allow you to change the y value which is most important.

**Middle**: The origin will be in the y center of the schematic
**Bottom**: The origin will be on the lowest point of you schematic
**Drop**: The origin will be at the lowest non air block in your schematic. This is the default value.
**Top**: The origin will be on the highest point of you schematic
**Raise**: The origin will be at the highest non air block in your schematic

`-placement:type`
`-place:type`
`-p:type`

Hint you can also use only the first letter of the type. This means that: `-p:d` is equal to `-placement:drop`.

#### YOffset
The y offset is applied after the placement changes. You can raise or lower a schematic before pasting.
This is useful for trees if you want be sure, that they will not be placed on top of gras.

`-yoffset:number`
`-yoff:number`
`-y:number`

#### Replaceall
On default the schematic brush only replaces air. We don't want to destroy existing structures.
This will change the behavioud. So we can replace blocks, which are solid.

`-replaceall`
`-repla`
`-r`

#### Placeair
On default, we don't place air block. If you want to change this use this flag.

`-includeair`
`-incair`
`-a`
